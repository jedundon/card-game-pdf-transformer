# GitHub Issue #79 Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Page group reordering arrows stopped working after pages were added to custom groups. The issue was caused by the `handleMoveGroupUp` and `handleMoveGroupDown` functions trying to update groups in the `pageGroups` array, but the default group was only created dynamically and not stored in this array.

## Root Cause
The default group was created in the `sortedGroupsWithDefault` memo but not persisted in the `pageGroups` array. When custom groups tried to swap positions with the default group, the operation failed silently because the default group couldn't be found in the array being updated.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Move Functions (`PageGroupsManager.tsx`)
Updated `handleMoveGroupUp` and `handleMoveGroupDown` to properly handle the default group:
- Check if either group in the swap involves the default group
- Add the default group to `pageGroups` array when needed for reordering
- Ensure both groups are available before performing the order swap

### 2. Added Comprehensive Tests
Created two test files:
- `PageGroupsManager.test.ts`: Unit tests for the group reordering logic
- `groupReorderingIntegration.test.ts`: Integration tests reproducing the exact issue scenario

### 3. Verified Fix
- **Empty custom groups**: Continue to work (wasn't broken)
- **Custom groups with pages**: Now work correctly (was broken, now fixed)
- **Default group reordering**: Works consistently in all scenarios
- **Page preservation**: All page assignments are maintained during reordering

## Files Changed
- `src/components/PageGroupsManager.tsx`: Fixed move functions
- `src/test/PageGroupsManager.test.ts`: Unit tests
- `src/test/groupReorderingIntegration.test.ts`: Integration tests

## Test Results
- All 72 existing tests continue to pass
- 17 new tests added specifically for group reordering
- Comprehensive coverage of all edge cases and scenarios

## Verification
The fix resolves the user confusion and workflow disruption described in the issue. Users can now:
- ✅ Reorder custom groups with pages using arrow buttons
- ✅ Experience consistent behavior between all group types
- ✅ Rely on arrow buttons remaining functional regardless of group content
- ✅ Maintain all page assignments during group reordering
