Current Card Preview should have a grey background behind the card to help the user identify where the card ends when they have a white background.

In the Page Preview section of Extract Cards, the currently selected card should be visible through the selection rectangle. The unselected cards should be lightly obscured as a visual indication that they are not selected. The part of the page outside the margins should be strongly obscured but still visible as an indicator of what is not being included in the card extraction.

Needs to have the ability to save the settings of the workflow for re-use later. Should default to naming the settings file the same as the PDF file so they are easy to recall. Additionally, the user should be able to load these settings to apply them to the currently loaded PDF. The settings controls should be visible across all pages, should support saving default values if the values haven't been changed yet, and should save the page settings, extract card settings, and configure layout settings but not the name of the imported PDF.

Step 3 should be called Configure Layout

Need gutter cropping
